      "If you had the power to create a Waqf today, what would it sustain? A library? A shelter? A forest?",

      "In the heart of a thriving kingdom, nestled between golden deserts and emerald forests, stood the prosperous city of Noorabad. The city was a melting pot of cultures, where Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and Sikhs lived in harmony. But beneath its glittering surface, poverty and suffering lurked in the shadows. The city’s wealthiest merchant, Hakim Suleiman, was a man of immense fortune but a restless soul. His ships carried silks and spices across oceans, his vaults overflowed with gold, yet his heart was heavy. Every day, he passed by the starving children, the sick lying untreated in the streets, and the elderly abandoned by time.",

      "One evening, as Hakim walked through the bustling marketplace, he saw a young girl, Laila, begging for coins to buy medicine for her ailing mother. Her eyes, filled with desperation, pierced his soul. He gave her a bag of gold, but as he walked away, he heard a voice whisper, 'What good is gold if it only feeds one stomach today but leaves a thousand hungry tomorrow?' Startled, Hakim turned to see an old Sufi mystic, his face serene, his gaze knowing. The mystic introduced himself as Sheikh Ibrahim and asked Hakim a simple yet profound question: 'Hakim, when the winds of time scatter your name like dust, what will remain of you?'",

      "That night, Hakim could not sleep. He thought of his ancestors, their names forgotten, their wealth squandered by heirs who cared little for legacy. At dawn, he summoned the city’s scholars, judges, and elders and declared his decision: 'I shall dedicate half of my wealth as Waqf—an eternal trust. This land and these riches will never be sold, never inherited, but used forever to serve those in need.' The crowd gasped. His own brother, Farid, protested, 'You rob your family of their future!' But Hakim stood firm. 'I do not rob them—I free them. A legacy of greed is a curse, but a legacy of service is a blessing.'",
